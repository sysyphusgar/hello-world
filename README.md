# hello-world

Hi!

Learning new things here. Coming from social sciences career (still on the way, never stop to read), now I am exploring a new field as I was always atracted by IT field (artificial intelligence understanding is the goal). I am starting with Python language, and then will see. Also coming back to math basics. Love coffee.
